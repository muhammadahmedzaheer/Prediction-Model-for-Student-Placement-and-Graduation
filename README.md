# Prediction-Model-for-Student-Placement-and-Graduation

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of predictive models for:
1. **Student Placement Prediction**: Predicting whether a student will secure a placement based on their academic records and other relevant features.
2. **Forecasting Graduation Year**: Estimating the year of graduation for students based on their college details and academic progress.

## Contents

- **datasets.zip**: Contains CSV files used for training and testing the models.
- **notebooks.zip**: Includes Jupyter notebooks with the code for both prediction and forecasting tasks.
- **output.zip**: Contains the CSV files with the model's predictions and forecasted graduation years.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required to run the notebooks.
- **LICENSE**: MIT License for this project.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation

To set up the environment for running the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of patient data with various features related to Parkinson's disease. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

## Usage
1. Data Preparation:
Ensure your dataset is structured correctly and loaded into the notebook.

2. Training the Model:
Run the training and evaluation cells in the notebook to train the models and evaluate their performance.

3. Inference:
Use the trained model to perform inference on new data by running the appropriate cells in the notebook.

## Results
The models achieve high accuracy and provide valuable insights into the progression of Parkinson's disease.
